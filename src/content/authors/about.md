If there was a theme to my life, it would be a life-long journey of self-discovery and learning. I feel that everyone goes through hardships, but it is not always cathartic. Some don't have the opportunity or freedom to learn from the struggles in their life to make theirs better. I view my work and my personal growth as a way to honor that opportunity—to turn curiosity into understanding and struggle into progress.
